/// warping the cursor to the primary monitor, clicking, and putting it back. That was visible, it
/// failed outright whenever another application had the cursor clipped (a full-screen game, a
/// remote-desktop host), and it broke the open-and-close behaviour of tray flyouts: the
/// synthesised click activated the taskbar, the owning application hid its flyout on losing
/// activation, and its icon handler then read the flyout as closed and opened it again.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Invoke opens, it does not close.</strong> Measured on kDrive, build 26200: from a closed
/// panel, <c>Invoke</c> opens it; a second <c>Invoke</c> leaves it open. Closing is a separate
