/// indication of which monitor, which is useless on a multi-monitor desktop.
/// <c>SHQueryUserNotificationState</c> is a getter with no notification, and it is global rather
/// than per monitor. <c>IAppVisibility</c> reports whether a monitor is showing immersive Windows 8
/// shell surfaces, which on Windows 11 is essentially never, and TranslucentTB uses it only to
/// detect the Start menu. What is left is looking at the windows, which is also what the shell does.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Why it enumerates instead of watching only the foreground window.</strong> A video
/// playing full screen on the secondary monitor stays full screen when you click something on the
/// primary. Judging by the foreground window alone would un-hide that monitor's mirror the moment
/// focus moved, which is exactly the symptom this is meant to fix. So each event triggers a sweep
/// of the top-level windows. The sweep is the response to an event, never a timer, so this remains
/// a subscription and not a poll.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Two out-of-process hooks drive it. <c>EVENT_SYSTEM_FOREGROUND</c> catches an application being
/// brought up full screen. <c>EVENT_OBJECT_LOCATIONCHANGE</c>, re-scoped to the foreground window's

/// resizes itself to full screen: a video going full screen in a browser raises no foreground
/// event at all.
